<h2>Blog</h2>

This is the blog module for mistet. As you can see, is simple, very simle, just
something to write some news on your site.
There's also an admin panel, that allows you to create/modify/delete a post online,
without editing resources/blog.xml and then upload it on your server. The admin panel
works only with php5, and such sucking hosting services like altervista don't have 
php5 support, bah.
