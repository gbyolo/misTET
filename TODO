FIX: Found CSRF in:
	-	security
	-	blog
	
Someone can change your admin password by using a hidden iframe and an auto submitting form, but ONLY if you've
logged in, otherwise nothing happens. 
This is the same for the blog module, if you've logged, someone can add, delete, edit a post.

I'll fix as soon it's possible.
