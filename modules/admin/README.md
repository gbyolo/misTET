<h2>Admin Module Panel</h2>

I decided to design this module because it is so boring editing my xml
files and then send them to the FTP account. It's written in PHP, because
in my opinion is easier to manage.

admin.php contains your password, change this:

	/* Here your password */
	define("PASSWORD", "meg");

with your own password.

<h2>Features</h2>
You can edit menu.xml and pages.xml online
