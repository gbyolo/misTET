I have, and I will have no intention to write IE support for misTET, since I never cared about that. If someone wants to help me do this, well, it would be beautiful :D.

<h2>Modules</h2>
misTET is also a modular cms, so you can write your own module without edit the main source. View /modules/README.md for more instructions.
