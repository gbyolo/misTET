<h2>Info:</h2>
misTET is a simple Ajax cms with XML support as regards menu and pages contents. Each XML file contain some instructions whose aim is to help you write something.<br>

	- misTET.js
	- prototype.js
	- files

/res/files folder:
	- menu.xm

The stat folder contains all the files such as extern documents, sources, archives, and the styles folder contains misTET's styles.<br>

Supported Browsers:<br>
	- Google Chrome >= 3 (testing previous versions)
	- Firefox >= 3.5.6 (testing previous versions)

I have, and I will have no intention to write IE support for misTET, since I never cared about that. If someone wants to help me do this, well, it would be beautiful :D.
