<h2>misTET framework</h2>

*misTET framework* is an useful framework needed at first by misTET but you can use it outside of that context. This caused me to separate the different parts of the framework and put them in /system/framework so that I can take and use them every time I want.

Read the [github wiki][1] about the framework or take a look at the sources for more information.
