**blog module**

This is the blog module for mistet. As you can see, is simple, very simle, just
something to write some news on your site.

Options:
	-	`#module=blog`: display all posts
	-	`#module=blog&id=idN`: display the post with the specified id
	-	`#module=blog&id=idN&del`: delete the post with the specified id
	-	`#module=blog&id=idN&edit`: edit the post with the specified id
	-	`#module=blog&show`: show all posts with the options of editing and deleting
	-	`#module=blog&post`: post a news

The blog module requires the security module, since all the functions above works only
with it.
