<!--
To create a new menu voice, just use `menu` node. Each `text` node represents
a new voice: if you use only one node, it is a simple menu, if you use
several ones, the first one represents the main voice, the other ones 
represent the sub menu. The `id` attribute is REQUIRED, since it must be 
the same you'll use for the specified page in pages.xml.
Don't use XML special characters.
